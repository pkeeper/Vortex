Experimental game engine on Python.
Idea:
	Make space ship simulator with realistic physics.
	Maps will be like tunel labyrinth from Matrix, no wide open spaces.
	Ship has few engines with limitations (max power, vector etc.).
	Ship can be controlled only through engines.
	User can write his own ship controller with very basic model 
		like "if key UP - ship max thrust UP",
		or more advanced with thrust control system 
		in witch there can be some engine modes and stabilization.
	Ship can be controlled by two players or through network, or even by AI.

	Engines dynamics are strictly defined, 
	ship models have power, mass, engine position limitations 
	but player can "install" compatible engines and get unique ship dymanics

Requirements:
	- Python 2.x
	- Pyglet
	- PyODE
